The Booking App is a full-featured appointment scheduling system built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It is designed for doctors to efficiently manage appointments, users, and payments — all within a single, modern web platform.
The platform provides role-based dashboards where users can book and track appointments, and admins (doctors) can manage schedules, approve or reject bookings, and view payment details.
This project focuses on real-world usability, security, and responsiveness — featuring image uploads, JWT authentication and cloud deployment.
